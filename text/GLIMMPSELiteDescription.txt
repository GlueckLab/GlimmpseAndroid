which helps students, statisticians and researchers in creating their one way ANOVA 
study designs even while they are traveling.

'GLIMMPSE Lite' is functionally a subset of our existing free, user friendly and 
open source web application GLIMMPSE. GLIMMPSE calculates power and sample size
for normally distributed outcomes.

Currently 'GLIMMPSE Lite' is supported on Android and iOS platforms which according 
to International Data Corporation (IDC) together hold a biggest market share of
mobile platforms.

'GLIMMPSE Lite' has gone through a rigorous testing and code refactoring for memory
